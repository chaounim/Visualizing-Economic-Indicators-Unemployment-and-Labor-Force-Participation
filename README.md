# Visualizing Economic Indicators: Unemployment and Labor Force Participation

This repository contains Python scripts for visualizing key economic indicators, focusing on the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate across the US states. The project utilizes data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data fetching, processing, and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly
- fredapi

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visualizing-economic-indicators.git

2. Install the required Python packages

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly fredapi

3. Obtain a FRED API key by registering at FRED's website. Replace the fred_key variable in the scripts with your API key.


### Usage

Run the scripts in a sequential manner to fetch, process, and visualize the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate across various US states. The scripts are designed to be modular and can be adjusted to explore other economic indicators available through FRED.

Start with data fetching and preprocessing:

Fetching unemployment and labor force participation rates.
Data cleaning and normalization.
Proceed with data visualization:

Generating time series plots.
Creating interactive visualizations with Plotly.
Comparing unemployment and labor force participation rates across states.
